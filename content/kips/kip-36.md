## Summary

A methodology in which to incentivize the creation of KIPs.

## Abstract

Authors of KIPs will now be eligible for KWENTA rewards for having KIPs implemented. 

## Motivation

Currently there is no clear benefit from participating in Kwenta governance as a non-token holder. By adding incentives for authors having KIPs implemented, the DAO will foster broader engagement and promote protocol innovation.

## Specification

Once a KIP reaches the Implemented stage, the adminDAO will classify the KIP into one of three rewards brackets. 

**Small impact** - 500 USD worth of KWENTA. This reward would be given to authors that implement a minor change to the protocol such as a parameter change, a small process change, or a small mechanism change to the product. Note that cosmetic product changes can be processed through the Kwenta product feedback session in the community which includes separate rewards. 

**Medium impact** - 1000 USD worth of KWENTA. This reward would be given to authors that implement a moderate change to the protocol such as multiple parameter changes, complex process changes, and new feature proposals. 

**Large impact** - 2000 USD worth of KWENTA. This reward would be given to authors that implement a major change to the protocol such as substantial governance framework changes, new complex features, and changes that result in a material benefit to the DAO. 

**Custom package** - For larger KIPs that require extensive involvement, the adminDAO may manufacture a custom rewards package that suits the KIP. 

All KWENTA follow the same vesting model as inflationary rewards. This KIP would have no retroactive benefit to existing KIPs and only serves to incentivize future KIPs. 

This KIP will go into effect once the KWENTA token is live.
