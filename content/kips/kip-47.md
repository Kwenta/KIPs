## Summary

Use a small percent from the reclaimed Trade Rewards allocation to hold regular contests.

## Abstract

KIP-43 reduced Trade Rewards from 20% of inflation to 5%. This proposal reallocates some of those reclaimed tokens as a prize for a reoccuring trade contest.

## Motivation

Trader acquisition and retention are critical targets for the next 12 months. Currently, there is very little to draw new users to the platform except its decentralized nature. We consistently see dramatically increased trade volumes during contests. A regular contest for a small prize could potentially generate reoccuring visits to the site, increasing likelihood that users will trade and stay. These tokens were already allocated as trade rewards, so using them to generate trade volume is an appropriate usage.

## Specification

These details can be adjusted each month, based on current news and activities. Monthly contests targetting specific metrics or pairs. 1% of months reclaimed Trade Reward tokens are distributed to top 10. Contests can be raw PnL percent, longs only, best single trade on a specific pair, focusing a new features, etc.  The important part is that is is regularl and predictable... first full week of every month or something...  and is low effort for the devs to implement and maintain.
