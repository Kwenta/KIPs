## Summary

An alternative model for the marketingDAO designed to increase output.

## Abstract

The marketingDAO structure will be adjusted to include a single member dedicated to execution with two advisory roles for support and planning. 

## Motivation

During the recent Kwenta Community Raise, the marektingDAO failed to offer meaningful output. The marketingDAO, therefore, demands further experimentation to improve performance. 

## Specification

The marketingDAO will be comprised of three members which will work with branches of the DAO to achieve growth through marketing initiatives. 

#### marketingDAO PM 

The marketingDAO PM will operate in a full-time capacity for the DAO to coordinate with the community on campaigns, bounties related to marketing, and general growth efforts for Kwenta. The marketingDAO PM will not be directly responsible for growth but will instead be responsible for facilitating the marketing initiatives within the community (much like the devDAO PM facilitates community development via tickets but is not directly responsible for managing the code). The marketingDAO PM will be appointed by the Core Contributor Committee and, once implemented in the future, the adminDAO. The Core Contributor Committee/adminDAO will be responsible for managing compensation for this role. 

#### marketingDAO Advisors 

The marketingDAO will include two marketingDAO Advisors. The responsibility of these members will be to provide direction for the marketingDAO PM with the goal of generating growth for the DAO. marketingDAO Advisors will be appointed by the Core Contributor Committee and, once implemented in the future, the adminDAO. The Core Contributor Committee/adminDAO will be responsible for managing compensation for this role. 

#### marektingDAO Structure

The marketingDAO PM and marketingDAO Advisors will meet routinely (other relevant DAO members can be invited to these meetings) in order to establish growth tactics for the DAO. The marektingDAO PM will then coordinate with the community through a structure and incentives system they deem suitable to execute on these tactics. The Core Contributor Committee/adminDAO will support the marketingDAO with organization, funding, and execution. The Core Contributor Committee/adminDAO will analyze the performance of marketingDAO members and adjust talent as needed.
