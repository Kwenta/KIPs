## Summary

A method to further decentralize the process of deploying code to the Kwenta protocol.

## Abstract

Distribute the signing rights for deploying code to the official version of Kwenta to both the Elite Council as well as the Core Contributors.

## Motivation

By providing the Elite Council with control over what version of Kwentaâ€™s code is the official version via onchain execution, the Kwenta DAO will further distribute control of the code to token holders. 

## Specification

There are a few steps for this proposal to be executed: 

1. Give the Elite Council and Core Contributors a multisig which requires either 3/6* votes, 5 of which are Elite Council members and 1 of which is for the Core Contributors (any Core Contributor). 
2. Enable transaction-based execution for directing which version of code the official Kwenta ENS is pointing to on IPFS. 
3. Change the main domain of Kwenta to: kwenta.eth.limo

\* Determined in feasibility that 3/6 was more secure than the originally proposed 2/6.
