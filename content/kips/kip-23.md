## Summary

This proposal updates the existing adminDAO proposal, KIP 12, to include a seat system that gives more control over compensation packages to the Core Contributors. 

## Abstract

The three positions appointed to the adminDAO will be decided via one seat selected by the Elite Council, one selected by the Core Contributors, and one selected by the Management Contributors. 

## Motivation

By enabling the Core Contributors to gain a degree of control over who will manage administrative responsibilities, it provides position security and reassurance, making working with the DAO more attractive to top talent.

## Specification

Moving forward, the Core Contributors will have the ability to reach consensus over one of the seats on the adminDAO, the Management Contributors will have the ability to reach consensus over one of the seats on the adminDAO, and the Elite Council will have the ability to reach consensus over one of the seats on the adminDAO. Since adminDAO membership is not epoch-dependent, this KIP would go into effect as soon the adminDAO reaches the implemented phase. The EC would lose the ability to appoint someone directly to the CC or MC adminDAO seats. If the CCs and/or MCs are unable to select someone for their adminDAO seat, the EC will select someone for them.
