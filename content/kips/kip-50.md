## Summary

## Abstract
This KIP would make the 50/50 split of the liqudity minining incentives between Veldrome & Uniswap permanent. 

## Motivation
The test of Velodrome's liquidity mining program in [KIP-46](https://kips.kwenta.io/kips/kip-46/) has concluded and successfully attracted more volume and TVL without incurring signifigant liqudity fragmentation. As such this KIP aims to make the 50% diversion of liqudity mining incentives to Velodrome permanent. 

## Specification
Kwenta should divert 50% of the current LM allocation (391.71625 KWENTA/month) towards bribing a Velodrome vAMM KWENTA/ETH pool.
