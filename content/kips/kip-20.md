## Summary

This proposal outlines a potential launch date for the KWENTA token.

## Abstract

In light of the recent market downturn, the community expressed interest in deferring the launch date of the token. After discussing the roadmap with advisory, the Kwenta CCs, and the community, we believe we have found an optimal date for the token launch.

## Motivation

Currently, the KWENTA token is set to launch as soon as auditor IOSIRO has approved the contracts (contracts are currently still in audit). A poll was held to determine if the community felt it would be favorable to launch at a later date which resulted in the community signaling deferring the launch by 1-6 months would be optimal. By deferring the launch date, we believe this will have a positive impact on attracting and retaining new users. 

## Specification

The token will launch on November 1st, 2022, assuming audits have been completed by this date.
