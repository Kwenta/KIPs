## Summary

A method to reward DAO contributors for their involvement. 

## Abstract

Inflationary Kwenta and a portion of fees captured by the Treasury will be distributed to DAO roles in order to reward participation, milestones, and innovation within the DAO. 

## Motivation

By rewarding DAO roles in a predictable manner, members will be driven to take initiative and advance the DAO. 

## Specification

The rewards system will follow the below outline. 

**Elite Council Members:**
- 2.5k USD in KWENTA each month.
- An additional 2.5k USD in KWENTA for the President.

**treasuryDAO:**
- 2.5k USD in KWENTA each month.

**adminDAO members:**
- 1k USD in KWENTA each month.

**Management Contributor:**
- 1k USD in KWENTA each month.
Note that only Core Contributors are elibile for this position. Management Contributor rewards are in addition to existing grants. 

**Core Contributors:**
- Negotiated salary via the adminDAO 
- Negotiated Kwenta package via the adminDAO 

**devDAO PM:**
- Negotiated salary via the adminDAO
- Negotiated Kwenta package via the adminDAO

**marketingDAO PM:** 
- Negotiated salary via the adminDAO
- Negotiated Kwenta package via the adminDAO

**Variable Upside Bonuses for Core Contributors:**
- The adminDAO will receive 1% of all inflation and 1% of all fees each month and reallocate these bonuses to the Core Contributors as they see fit. 

**Milestones Bonuses:**
- As milestones are reached on the roadmap, the Core Contributors will earn milestone bonuses (See KIP 33). The treasuryDAO will determine a budget for each epoch's milestone bounties. The adminDAO will be tasked with distributing a completed milestones bonus to relevant contributors. 

This KIP overrules the amount of compensation set aside for the Elite Council in KIP-2. All KWENTA distributed in this KIP follows the infaltionary reward vesting model (1-year lock up with burn-to-vest clause) aside from the negotiated Kwenta packages.
