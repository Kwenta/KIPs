## Summary

Diversify the treasury into a basket of different stablecoins, hedging the risk that a single stable will de-peg. 

## Request

The treasury would be composed of the following breakdown: 
50% sUSD, 25% DAI, and 25% USDC. 

## Address

Kwenta OP Treasury 

## Rationale

To mitigate the risk of the treasury being negatively impacted due to a single stablecoin de-pegging, I propose that the Kwenta treasury be diversified into the top three Ethereum-based stablecoins. In the event that a single stablecoin does de-peg, the treasury will be able to utilize an alternative currency to continue fueling operations.
